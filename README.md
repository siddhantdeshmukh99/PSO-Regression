# PSO-Regression
Wrote a regression model whose weights are optimized by hybrid of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization

Just a fun activity. Read some where that we can use PSO to search in vector space,
so thought to implement it and use it to search the vector space of the mean squared error function
and tried to minimize it and fit the model. Never thought that it was at par or sometimes even better than 
the standard Normal equation.
